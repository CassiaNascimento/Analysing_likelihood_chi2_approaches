# Analysing_SNANA_LC_fits

Here, following Lago et al. 2012 we analyse the effects in cosmology of considering the complete likelihood or only the chi-squared when performing MCMC. 
March et al. 2011 predicts a bias, that we verify affects only the nuisance parameters in a proportional fashion shifting the values in the same increasing
direction. This effect on \alpha and \beta compensates each other and litlle to no effect is seen on the cosmological parameters contours.
